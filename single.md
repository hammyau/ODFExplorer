### Create a document

Let's create a simple document. To do this I'm going to use [Apache OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/)
But you could equally use [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or [Calligra](https://www.calligra.org/)

My simple test document is looks like.

As you can see not very interesting.

### Process the document

Enter a comment maybe. And via the green Choose button and the corresponing file chooser select your file.

There is some info about this run of the document and a summary of the tree of elements that make up the document.
63 paths with an average depth of 5. Typically documents form wide and shallow trees.

The same document may be processed a number of times and each run will show up in this table.
The entiries have the date and comment to help you identify them.

Click on the run.

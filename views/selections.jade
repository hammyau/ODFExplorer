              br
              | This leads to many more paths than if just the type of node is used.
              br 
              | Setting the hide attributes checkbox means attributes are no long considered when creating an XPath graph.
              br 
              | This can be a useful way to compress a graph to just visualise the paths in the document.
              br 
              | Hide Attributes is not enabled when the mode is Aggregate, aggregation always ignores the attributes.

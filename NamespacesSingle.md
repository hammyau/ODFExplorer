### What are namespace gauges?

The ODF schema elements are defined as being members of a given namespace.

The ODF explorer pulls apart the document to see which elements of which a namespace are used.

The resulting summary table for our simple document is below.

We can see we have "hit" elements from the dc, office, meta, styles, and text namespaces.

### Drilldown

Of course you may well wonder which elements were "hit".

The Drilldown table allows you to select elements and the attributes within an element.

Green means it has been hit.
There is a handy dandy pop up which shows the document and the number of hits too. But that is more useful when comparing documents.

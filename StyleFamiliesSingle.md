### Style Families
Within an ODF document the styles applied to paragraphs and other elements are managed in a hierachy.
The ODF Explorer extracts the styles of a document and displays them via a drill down table.

A style typically has paragraph and text properties associated with it. They can be seen in the drill down too.
The properties applied to a paragraph are the aggregate of those seen when walking up the tree. That is lower levels either add to or override parent level properties.

The green entries in the drill down show the styles used with the document.
Typically many more styles are defined than are actually used.

  <h3 id="xpath-graph">XPath Graph</h3>

<p>The full XPath Graph contained within the column of this page is below.
This just shows how wide and shallow the tree is.
Here is a link to <a href="/images/xpathgraph.svg">the full image</a>.
Hovering over an element will show a tooltip with its properties (at least those that fit into the tooltip - may have to work on that).

<p>The ODF Explorer presents the graph within its framework and provides a mechanism to filter out sections ot the tree.
To hide a section click on a node and it will be added to the filter list.</p>

<p>Here is a filtered view to show the elements below the document_content/body/text.</p>

<h3 id="where-do-the-numbers-come-from">Where do the numbers come from?</h3>

<p>In order to understand the numbers lets peek into the XML.</p>

<p><img src="/images/test1DocParaXML.png" alt="contentXML" /></p>

<p>There is one path to the heading.
There are two paths the end in a text:p.
There are two separate paths below a text:p to the two T1 and T2 span elements.</p>

<p>This is how the original document with its heading and three paragraphs, one with some bold text, show up.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-the-names-mean">What to the names mean?</h3>

<p>The element names are of the form namespace:element.
For paragraphs and headings the associated style is in paranthesis ... para(style).</p>

<h3 id="what-do-the-colours-signify">What do the colours signify?</h3>

<p>The colours are derived from the namespace.</p>

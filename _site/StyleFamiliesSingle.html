<p>Within an ODF document the styles applied to paragraphs and other elements are managed in a hierachy.
The ODF Explorer extracts the styles of a document and displays them via a drill down table.</p>

<p>A style typically has paragraph and text properties associated with it. They can be seen in the drill down too.
The properties applied to a paragraph are the aggregate of those seen when walking up the tree. That is lower levels either add to or override parent level properties.</p>

<p>The green entries in the drill down show the styles used with the document.
Typically many more styles are defined than are actually used.</p>

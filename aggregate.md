### Find some groups of documents

Aggregation is about seeing the cumulative changes of a document or set of documents.

I have extracted some test documents from [Apache OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/). They are of different types, that is spreadsheets, presentations, and text documents.

### Aggregate a group or one

I'll get the picture soon...

### Not the same option of reports

Aggregating the style families over a number of documents doesn't realy make sense. So the style family report does not work.

Genertating XPath graphs based on the aggregates of elements doesn't really make sense either. In the single case a path to a paragraph element is defined taking into account its attributes (style name). For aggregation we are just interested in general how the elements are connected.

This makes for far few paths.

details to come...

### XPath Drill Down

The underlying data displayed here is the same as used in the [XPath Graph](XPathGraphSingle.md)

The view shows the drill down to the elements under the document/body/text.

The table is just a javascript thing and should be available to all users. The graph view however is dependent upon having [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) installed.
The ODF Explorer should run just the same but the resulting dot files will not be processed to produce graphs.

See the discussion in the graph for more information.
